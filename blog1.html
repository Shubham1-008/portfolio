    <p>Shreemad Bhagwat geeta is not a spiritual text that can only be read by a hindu but its a way of living for everyone.Each person no matter from which community he or she belongs should read Bhagwat geeta .Bhagwat geeta is the teaching that Lord Krishna gave to Arjuna during the Holy War of Mahabharata.During this holy war Arjuna thought to quit ithe war but then krishna couraged him to fight in the battlefield and to acconplish his Kshtriya Dharma.In Same way sometime we feels like a failure all the positivity get rinsed out of life only the negative thoughts cropwded us with their negative feelings in this situation a person tends to give up .But the Shreemad Bhagwat geeta tell us the way to overcome the failure and to move ahead in the life </p>
    
    
    <h1 id="jsbap">Similarities in Bhagwat geeta and life</h1>
    <p>In the first chapter of Bhagwat geeta we sees that Dhritrastra the father of kaurvas asks his companion vidhur to tell him about the scenerio of battle filed of Mahabharta with his divine powers .And when Vidhur starts explaining him the conditions of Battle field n start telling him the glory of pandavas. Dhritrastra strongly condemned vidhur to talk anything about pandvas. He only wants to listen about his own sons Kauravas.Same scenerio can seen in todays world every parent wants to listen about the growth of their child by making others child behind. But they cant tolerate if any other child overcame their child . </p>
    <h1 id="AIh1">Adoption of Love and compassion</h1>
    
    <p>In todays world the need for reading Bhagwat geeta is that Now a days everyone is feeling stressed tensed and anxious with their day to day lifestyle or with many other external factors like their relationships n all evryone is fed up with their life . there is no motive left in anyones life to be loved by anyone or to spread love or comapssion.</p>
    <p>By reading Shreemad BHagwat Geeta one will get his answers of the questions that he keep asking himslef all over his life but never get answered by anyone.Bhagwat geeta trie to tech us that the answers of our question are always within us we just need a way to explore ourself then our answers will come out by their own </p>
    <p>In the starting of Mahbaharta Arjuna was failed as a warrior , the situation and the condition around him make him unstable and he looses his stability to think what to do or what to not. Some times same incidenst happens in our life .We didnot undersatnd to know what can we do now in that cases one should try to be calm and to rethink of the situation again and then make a plan and after that he should execute that plan in order to get out of any bad situation. </p>
    <h1 id="ct">Importance of Sense Organs </h1>
    <p>We humans are given with five sense organs in our body that organs are (Eyes,Ear,Skin,Mouth,Nose).These senses seems to be very normal but in facts they are the mightes thing that a human being posssess. In Bhagwat Geeta Krishna Emphasises over the fact that one should learn or practice to control his senses with his will. Krshna says that the senses should work according to a man but the thing is that the man is the slave of his sense . He keeps on satisfying his senses and then gradually he tends to loose his grip over his mentak state n start becoming unstable. So everyone should know how to control over the senses and to conquer them to have a stable mind  and lifestyle.</p>
    <p>The negative emotions within a humna being makes him weaker. All the negative emotions that emerges within his mind or body or he adapts form his enviornment act as a parasite to his own self. The negative emotions like Anger, Jealousy,Stres and Anxiouesness should be controlled or hey can ruin you. So to overcame all theior things everyone should try "HARE KRISHNA MAHAMANTRA" that is "hare krishna hare krishna krishna krshna hare hare, hare rama hare rama rama rama harehare" .This mantra will act as a nectar for anyone who is unstable state of his body or mind
